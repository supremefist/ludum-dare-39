# Running out of steam

Entry for Ludum Dare 39 48h game development competition.

Shovel coal into the furnace, create steam and use the steam to power the train.

Don’t let the steam chamber explode. Get your cargo to the other station! Don’t run out of steam! You deliver the cargo by stopping in front of the final station right before the cliff.
